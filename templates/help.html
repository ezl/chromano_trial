    <p><b>1. Active</b> &mdash; When the Price Watch is active this circle will be green and you will receive a notification when your stock reaches the specified "lower" and "upper" thresholds. When the Price Watch is inactive this circle will be red and you will not receive any notifications regarding this stock. All newly created Price Watches are active by default.</p>
    <p><b>2. Price</b> &mdash; This is the current price of the stock.</p>
    <p><b>3. Lower/Upper</b> &mdash; These are the low and high prices thresholds that you defined. If this stock reaches either of these prices, you will receive an alert as long as your Price Watch is active.</p>
    <p><b>4. SMS alerts</b> &mdash; If the cell phone icon is ON, then you will receive a text message to your cell phone number when the Low or High price threshold is reached. You must enter and verify your cell phone number in your profile to receive text messages.</p>
    <p><b>5. E-mail alerts</b> &mdash; If the cell phone icon is ON, then you will receive a text message to your cell phone number when the Low or High price threshold is reached. This e-mail address is defined in your profile and can be the same as or different than your log-in e-mail.</p>
    <p><b>6. Delete Button</b> &mdash; You can delete a Price Watch from your dashboard at any time by clicking the X button at the far right of each price bar.</p>
