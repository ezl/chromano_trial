        <h3>Do I need a credit card to register?</h3>
        <p>Nope. We offer a free personal plan which won't require a credit card to get you started.
           You will need a credit card to take the 30-day free trial on a paid account, but your
           card won't be billed until the trial period is up and you've renewed the account.</p>

        <h3>How long can I use the free account for before I have to upgrade?</h3>
        <p>You can use the free account for as long as you please, and we'll never bother you about
           upgrading. We offer a variety of plans that we think will suit everyone from freelancers
           to large companies.</p>

           you'd like. If you cancel in the middle of the month, you'll be charged for that month,
           but we won't subject you to any annual contracts or additional fees.</p>
